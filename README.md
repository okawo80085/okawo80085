### ‚ú® the public ~~shit~~ stuff im working on ‚ú®
*most of my work over is not public and not hosted on github*

* [void-bootstrap](https://github.com/okawo80085/void-bootstrap) - void linux build stuff :D
* [HoboVR-Labs/hobo-vr2](https://github.com/HoboVR-Labs/hobo-vr2) - some stuff about openvr drivers, it works on linux, didn't bother checking anything else, if i ever get the time i'll make some hardware for it
* [HoboVR-Labs/lazy-sockets](https://github.com/HoboVR-Labs/lazy-sockets) - dont even remember why i made this, its been years, something about c++ sockets, honestly boost is better
* [okawo80085/lose](https://github.com/okawo80085/lose) - actually something usefull, sliced access to big datasets with minimal ram usage, only the slice is loaded into ram
