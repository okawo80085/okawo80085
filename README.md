### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an embebed developer, usually working on OpenVR drivers, some weird lib, some small app, finding some new horrible way to use python or something Linux related in my free time :)

### ðŸ”­ My current projects
* [HoboVR-Labs/hobo_vr](https://github.com/HoboVR-Labs/hobo_vr) - Bundle of prototyping tools and an OpenVR driver
* [HoboVR-Labs/lazy-sockets](https://github.com/HoboVR-Labs/lazy-sockets) - Thin cross-platform socket wrapper for C++
* [okawo80085/openvr](https://github.com/okawo80085/openvr) - Patched for Linux version of OpenVR
* [okawo80085/lose](https://github.com/okawo80085/lose) - Python data handling library optimized for huge datasets and low ram usage
* And a few other VR projects that are not open yet :)

### ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with
I'm currently looking for help/contributors with hobo_vr's driver, from all of the contributors in the project no one apart from me dares to touch the driver. Working as a one man army is great and all, but I need new eyes on this thing, I'm not perfect, I'm missing bugs and generally not fast enough on the version release rate, most of which is caused by the lack of review in driver PRs(not meant as an insult to other contributors, driver development is complicated from many points of view and is complicated even more by the sheer amount of devices this driver needs to support).

So if you have some time to spare and are interested in OpenVR drivers, please consider contributing to [HoboVR-Labs/hobo_vr](https://github.com/HoboVR-Labs/hobo_vr) (even if it's just a simple code comment, no matter how small, every single contribution helps) :)

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about
Ask me anything about OpenVR or VR in general :P

### ðŸ“« How to reach me
Email: oleg.vorobiov@somainline.org or oleg.vorobiov@hobovrlabs.org

### âš¡ Fun fact
The number of applications that still use the deprecated OpenVR APIs is at the same time concerning and showing how much people still rely on obsolete examples :/
